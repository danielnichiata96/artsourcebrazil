With an audience of millions, our games are a gateway to unforgettable characters, vibrant worlds, and emotionally rich experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is no small mission, but our secret weapon is our people. We are a collective of versatile, curious, and passionate artists working in synergy with designers, engineers, and PMs to create iconic mobile games. We embrace innovation and creative ownership, and are continuously evolving our processes, including exploring how emerging tools like Gen-AI can support faster and more inspired iterations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Our Senior 3D Game Artists are adaptable creators who contribute across multiple areas of art to bring 3D games to life. You’ll work closely with cross-disciplinary teams to transform ideas into compelling visual experiences, from early prototypes to polished production assets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Developer: &lt;/strong&gt;You&#39;re passionate about making games. You understand how visuals influence gameplay, UX, and player engagement. You enjoy working collaboratively to solve problems and deliver high-quality results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versatile Artist: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re comfortable moving between 2D and 3D disciplines (concepting, modelling, texturing, lighting, or animating as needed). You have a solid understanding of creating game-ready assets efficiently without sacrificing visual appeal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Native Explorer: &lt;/strong&gt;You are not just a user of AI tools—you push them. You understand how to control model consistency, build custom prompts, use inpainting workflows, and combine Gen-AI results with traditional techniques (paintover, photobash, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Player:&lt;/strong&gt; You are a self-motivated team player who proactively seeks feedback and shares knowledge. You are good interacting with a wide range of people, from very distinct backgrounds and specialities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engine Expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;You have experience working with Unity and or other game engines, as well as Git, knowing your way from the folder structures to implementing a fully playable game.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll do:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration: &lt;/strong&gt;You will be part of multiple teams, with distinct members, objectives and problems to solve in each of them. You&#39;ll also be communicating with a wide range of stakeholders, from junior game developers and game designers all the way to senior leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Solving:&lt;/strong&gt; You will help transform GDDs into playable mobile games, as well, as help define the pipelines for the next phases of development. That means that you will encounter all sorts of problems and obstacles along the way, working your way around them as efficiently as possible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iteration&lt;/strong&gt;: You will iterate in multiple ways to find the best solution for gameplay and the overall player experience. That means working fast, failing fast and making corrections also fast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and evolve workflows: &lt;/strong&gt;You&#39;ll help define how and when we use Gen-AI, which tools we adopt, and how we ensure output quality and consistency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll need:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience making multiple games, as an indie and/or inside a game studio.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience working with Unity engine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with a 3D software package.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intermediate oral and written communication skills in English.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A portfolio showcasing your work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build the best gaming company, where everyone thrives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note that an art test may be required during the evaluation process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Wildlife&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Wildlife is one of the leading mobile game developers and publishers in the world.

With an audience of millions, our games are a gateway to unforgettable characters, vibrant worlds, and emotionally rich experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is no small mission, but our secret weapon is our people. We are a collective of versatile, curious, and passionate artists working in synergy with designers, engineers, and PMs to create iconic mobile games. We embrace innovation and creative ownership, and are continuously evolving our processes, including exploring how emerging tools like Gen-AI can support faster and more inspired iterations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our 2D Game Artists are adaptable creators who contribute across multiple areas of art to bring games to life. You’ll work closely with cross-disciplinary teams to transform ideas into compelling visual experiences, from early prototypes to polished production assets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who you are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Developer: &lt;/strong&gt;You&#39;re passionate about making games. You understand how visuals influence gameplay, UX, and player engagement. You enjoy working collaboratively to solve problems and deliver high-quality results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Worldbuilder: &lt;/strong&gt;You think in stories, moods, and aesthetics. You’re great at using images to evoke emotion, suggest lore, and communicate style direction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Creator: &lt;/strong&gt;You bring strong 2D fundamentals (composition, color, anatomy, lighting), and you’re also comfortable using Gen-AI tools to sketch ideas, refine directions, or build references faster.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Native Explorer: &lt;/strong&gt;You are not just a user of Gen-AI tools—you push them. You understand how to control model quality, build custom prompts, use inpainting workflows, and combine Gen-AI results with traditional techniques (paintover, photobash, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Player:&lt;/strong&gt; You are a self-motivated team player who proactively seeks feedback and shares knowledge.

You will not be alone, we have a set of art directors and a strong art department to support you in delivering your best.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Game Artist: &lt;/strong&gt;Your premiere skill will be 2D art, but at times you will have the opportunity to work with other art specialities depending on what is best for the game, ranging from UI to some level of 3D and animation. We call it T-shaped artists.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration: &lt;/strong&gt;You will be part of a multidisciplinary team, everyone focused on creating a unique game experience. You will be able to contribute to shaping the game design to find the fun. You will also collaborate with other Wildlife areas, such as Marketing, to define the Art theme of the game using real data from players.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Solving:&lt;/strong&gt; You will help transform GDDs into playable mobile games, as well, as help define the pipelines for the next phases of development.

That means working fast, failing fast and making corrections also fast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build and evolve workflows: &lt;/strong&gt;You&#39;ll help define how and when we use Gen-AI, which tools we adopt, and how we ensure output quality and consistency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A strong portfolio with examples of illustration, concept art, and visual storytelling.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience creating artwork for games, animation, comics, or entertainment IPs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proficiency with Photoshop (or equivalent painting tools).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated use of Gen-AI tools in your process, with clear artistic direction.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High/Intermediate communication skills in English.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build the best gaming company, where everyone thrives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that an art test may be required during the evaluation process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Wildlife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wildlife is one of the leading mobile game developers and publishers in the world.
