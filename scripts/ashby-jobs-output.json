    "description": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one— I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.\n\nThis is a staff-level role, so we require at least 5 years of experience as a full-time frontend engineer or evenly split between frontend and design for this role and significant contributions to (or leading) design systems.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers spend less than 4 hours per week in meetings (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication). \n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience 💪🏾\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nGIVE ENGINEERS OWNERSHIP & AUTONOMY\n\nWe, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY \n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups (including my daughter!).\n\nToday, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds with some casual Zoom (or in-person) coffee in between to get to know each other: \n\n 1. 30-minute introduction call to discuss Ashby and your past work (we demo Ashby!)\n\n 2. A technical screen (take home or, for more experienced folks who want it, a 90-minute live session)\n\n 3. A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 45 minutes (can be split across two days) \n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews. You’ll meet other engineering leaders and 4 to 6 engineers (with 15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST TWO MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in delivering a prominent, impactful feature. We’ll pair you with a peer who’ll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nOur tech stack is TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, a mix of SASS modules and Stitches, Apollo GraphQL, Node.js, Postgres, and Redis. We're looking for folks with deep React, CSS, and HTML knowledge for this role.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅.\n\n - Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "Hi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Director of Engineering, Europe. How do you feel about engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets? If that sounds exciting (even if a bit scary), read on because I’m looking for an engineering manager to help us build a different type of engineering team and culture at Ashby.\n\nTo start, why do we need to be different? Time and again, I have witnessed engineers knowing what needs to be done yet being unable to get things done because of “the process” or because “more data is needed.” Some of the most effective projects have been skunkworks projects, where engineers have taken total ownership of a problem and driven it to completion. I want to normalize that at Ashby.\n\nWhen we think about how these processes came about, we realize they carry a pessimistic mindset. They box people into smaller roles to minimize the chance of not meeting a certain standard. At Ashby. we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve and embraces the innovative engineers (and frankly, often stays out of their way).\n\nTo accomplish this, our engineering leaders need to think deeply about individual performance, process, and culture - not running sprint planning or driving product and technical decisions. You’ll focus on building your team, their skills to thrive with the ownership they’re given, and an environment that empowers them to do their best work consistently, with little distraction. For junior EMs we try to stay within 6 direct reports. This enables them to spend time with our teams observing, correcting, praising, and, yes, coding. We like our managers to be hands-on while also making sure they’re not on the critical path.\n\nWe’ve already gathered an experienced, talented, and collaborative team https://www.ashbyhq.com/team of 25+ engineers. You’ll help me manage the growing team of engineers in Europe.\n\nIn addition to working with engineers you’ll also get to work on projects yourselves. Some examples of work our engineering leaders have done:\n\n - Provide feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects, and deliver them with little intervention. They still ask for help when needed - the difference is that they’re driving.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\n\nWHY BE A MANAGER?\n\nI had two experiences early in my career that set me on my path. I had a great manager who asked tonnes of questions about the decisions I was making and coached me without me realizing it. And I had a terrible manager - being told to work harder after a week of 3am finishes was not what I needed as a young engineer. The stark difference between these two experiences motivated me to become a manager: I wanted every engineer I worked with to have the support I had in the best case.\n\nSince then, as I’ve learned more, I’ve realized that I love the kind of problems I get to solve as a manager. Deeply complex problems with long-term impact both on the company and on people’s lives. One of my proudest achievements is creating a fully transparent pay system, and on the day it was revealed, everybody was happy with it. Nobody stormed out. By spending time thinking deeply about everybody’s pay and ensuring the mechanics of promotion were clear, I put the team in a place where they could see a peer was paid more than them, and it not be a problem.\n\nDespite all this, I love being technical. I sometimes indulge myself and spend a morning writing some code to improve tests or provide better abstractions. If I couldn’t be a manager, I’d be super happy to be an IC.\n\nI’m looking for someone who is passionate. Passionate about both management and being technical. Someone who spots a pattern amongst their team, figures out a better way for us to operate, and then builds the automation that powers it. I introduced a new process that enables engineers to merge 30% of PRs without a human review beforehand. I also built the automation that approves these PRs. I also built that automation with abstractions that make it easy for the engineers to improve the automation themselves.\n\nIt can be hard to find seasoned engineering leaders who haven’t succumbed to the status quo in some way or another. We're committed to giving all our people a total and utter lack of terrible managers, and that means we're willing to take a chance on someone early in their leadership journey who's courageous, principled, and has the drive to build themselves into a great leader who can say “Yah I know everyone is doing that, but we won't because...”\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nEngineering leadership comes in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. I thought I’d outline some things I’m looking for to help you decide if this fits what you’re looking for:\n\n - You love being technical and can hold in-depth conversations with direct reports from infra to backend to frontend.\n\n - You enjoy management problems. We want people who get excited about driving people to be their best, giving difficult feedback, and building systems that make this easier\n\n - You hold your team to a high standard and don’t shy away from getting into the details and giving feedback, even to the best folks on your team.\n\n - You are an excellent and empathetic communicator. Facilitating change at both an individual and organization level requires understanding how to navigate the beliefs, opinions, and past experiences of engineers and figuring out how to both convince them of a new way of doing things while also leaving yourself open to feedback.\n\n - You know what exceptional engineers look like. You’ve thought deeply about what makes them tick, how to recruit them, and how to grow folks into them. I want to see depth here, the industry often regurgitates a vanilla description, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\n - You’re good at thinking about product, business, and maybe even design, but you’re not interested in calling the shots and are more interested in building a team that can make the best decisions without you.\n\n - You thrive in high-trust, high-autonomy environments. We're a young startup where leaders wear multiple hats, and you'll build your own (high-speed) on-ramp through developing strong feedback loops.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology.\n\n - You’ve gotten into management because it was the only growth path available\n\n - You want to make all the product decisions instead of empowering your team to make those calls.\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers that are predominantly early-career, mid-career, or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. With enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - A staff or principal engineer to you is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews.\n\n - You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently than the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nTalent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵\n\nAshby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have many customers, great revenue growth, years of runway, and amazing investors like YCombinator, Elad Gil, and Lachy Groom. I’ll share more once we meet.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL, COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers can focus 36h out of a 40h work week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication). Even managers can rely on getting consistent time (and support to make, if necessary) to focus and do creative work without the demand of constant meetings.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 5x a day.

All of us in technical leadership did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution.

These are skills that we often don’t get to practice as engineers, and, as a manager at Ashby, you’ll provide mentorship and feedback to engineers to ensure they are successful when delivering projects.\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter. As the father of two young girls, I want to see them grow up in a world where all industries are open and welcoming to everyone, regardless of race, gender, or preferences. Helping to build a more diverse team at Ashby is my way of contributing to this change.\n\nToday, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together. Our interview process is six interviews in the following order:\n\n 1. Intro Call (30m) - Discuss your application questions, align on the responsibilities of the role, and answer questions about Ashby.\n\n 2. Past Experience Deep Dive (1h) - Discuss your past experience as an engineering leader.\n\n 3. Technical Screen (1h) - Add a feature back to Ashby. You'll spend most of your time understanding a specific part of our codebase and write less than 15 lines of code.\n\n 4. Coffee Chat with VP of Engineering (1h) - Spend time with our VP of Engineering and get to know each other.\n\n 5. Meet the Team (2h) - At this point, the engineering leadership team is excited about you and you'll meet our CEO, Engineers, Product Managers, and some other folks on the team.\n\nI will be your main point of contact and prepare you for interviews.

    "jobTitle": "High Touch Customer Success Manager - EST",
    "description": "ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nHi, I’m Beth, and I’m the Manager of High Touch Customer Success at Ashby. Our team is passionate about shaping and scaling an exceptional high-touch customer experience across the mid-market segment. I'm thrilled to be hiring our next CSM in the EST timezone, as we continue expanding globally.\n\nAs a member of our Customer Success team, you will help us continue to grow our High Touch Customer Success function. In this role, you'll onboard, train, and support the adoption of Ashby with customers across the region, partnering closely with a talented group of seven CSMs on the Americas High Touch team to shape how we serve companies ranging from high-growth startups to public enterprises.\n\nAshby is designed to be powerful and flexible, allowing users to adjust it to their needs. This means that there is a lot to learn. You will become a product and domain expert in order to enable our customers to make the best use of Ashby to drive hiring excellence.\n\nRole Requirements:\n\n - You have a strong track record of customer success experience in B2B SaaS (at least two years), supporting the implementation and adoption of complex technologies. In this role, you will manage a four to eight week implementation, while continuing to deliver value through the customer journey.\n\n - You’re comfortable managing a book of ~60 mid-market customers, exceeding $1.5MM in total ARR. You enjoy developing relationships across a broad set of stakeholders while supporting existing teams to drive adoption and retention\n\n - You have experience working closely with cross-functional stakeholders across Sales, Marketing, Product, and Operations.\n\n - You love becoming a product and industry expert and have experience doing this in a previous customer success role. You can create ‘Ah ha!’ moments by tailoring training and product walk throughs to address a customer’s specific challenges.\n\n - You’ve worked with technically complex products and show a strong curiosity to explore details and understand how things work.\n\nYou Should Apply If:\n\n - 📣 You demonstrate mastery of clear communication. You ask questions with precision and can explain complex concepts in simple terms. You eschew business jargon.\n\n - 🎧 You are a great listener. You see your role as providing the voice of the customer to internal stakeholders so we can ensure that our product roadmap continues delivering value.\n\n - 📊You enjoy working with a larger book of varied customers, and can effectively prioritise your time to make the biggest impact.\n\n - 🧩 You’re energized by learning and supporting a complex product. You enjoy diving deep into technical details, navigating advanced configurations, and data workflows, and you enjoy helping customers make sense of them.\n\n - 🧑‍🏫 You love to teach. Whether it’s a complex report to a very tenured data analyst, or a workflow to a brand new recruiter, who is new to SaaS tools, you see every teaching moment as an opportunity.\n\n - ⚙️ You are not only excited about driving renewals, but also crafting repeatable processes that will allow our go-to-market team to scale well in future.\n\n - 🔍 Your peers describe you as detail oriented. You obsess over sending crisp follow-up emails, on time. You take pride in internal operations, like real-time CRM updates.\n\n - ⚡️ You move fast. You leverage tools/technology to maximize your time. You are at home managing a wide range of customers, and prioritizing effectively.\n\n - 🗺️ You're energized by an ever-improving work environment. Our team is growing, and continually iterating on processes - we live by our Operating Principle of \"Implement Continuous Improvement\"\n\n - 📊 You are always looking for ways to improve your work through data.\n\n - 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧 You have been a recruiter, hiring manager or interviewer in a previous role. Recruiting experience paired with SaaS CSMing helps to make the onboarding process quicker, and can help you serve as a trusted advisor to our customers. Not a requirement though!\n\nWhy you shouldn’t apply:\n\n - If you tend to thrive with a smaller, more focused book of customers, this role likely isn’t the right fit. Our High Touch CSMs typically manage a book of 60+ customers, balancing personalized relationships with efficient, scalable support.\n\n - You're interested in managing customer accounts with infrequent and well-defined touchpoints (rather than excited by the fluidity required of early stage CS work)\n\n - You shine as an exclusively commercial CSM, motivated by variable compensation. While our team's north star metric is revenue retention, we focus on adoption and engagement as our leading indicators. For renewal negotiation and upsell, we have a lovely team of Contract Managers. As such, this role does not currently include variable pay, aligning with our strategy to hire product-oriented CSMs rather than adhering to the conventional Account Manager model.\n\n - You’re afraid of rolling up your sleeves. If the idea of getting in the weeds with a customer about the nuance between a time in process report and a time to hire report feels too granular, or project managing a workflow change for offer approvals feels “beneath you”, this job isn’t going to be for you.\n\n\nABOUT ASHBY\n\nWe’re building the next generation of enterprise software, and we’re starting with a suite of products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run their hiring process significantly better.

We have thousands of amazing customers including Snowflake, OpenAI, Shopify, Ramp, Notion, and Zapier (and many others who we cannot name!). Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nOur interview process is thorough - we aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:\n\n - Intro Call with Ashby Recruiting - 30 Minutes\n\n - Hiring Manager Interview - 45 Minutes\n\n - Mock Customer Call - 45 Minutes\n\n - Virtual Onsite - 2 hours\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - You’ll get the time to do things the right way; we put a lot of emphasis on high quality work and avoid quick hacks as much as possible.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby - do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks is recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅\n\n - Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾, I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby’s Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby’s success and ambition mean we’re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.\n\nOur product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a better experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.\n\nA big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to actually be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you’ve found the right place.\n\nAs an Engineering Manager, you’ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.\n\nYou’ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You’ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They’ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:\n\n - Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\nYou’ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:\n\n - Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.\n\n - Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\nI’ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\n - You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology. We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.\n\n - You follow the rules and accept the hand you’ve been dealt. We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it’s within their own team or across departments.\n\n - You went into management because it was the only growth path available. We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews. You don’t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.\n\n - You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou’ll be an important part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)\n\n 6. Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don’t move forward, we’re happy to share feedback.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you’ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don’t worry if you don’t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you’ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾, I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby’s Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a great (former) engineer who built impressive products and now builds teams of great engineers. Ashby’s success and ambition mean we’re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.\n\nOur product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a better experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.\n\nA big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional, figure out how to hire them, and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to actually be exceptional. In other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you’ve found the right place.\n\nAs an Engineering Manager, you’ll work closely with me, Colin, and your peers to build out the team and continue scaling this unique culture.\n\nYou’ll first do that through grassroots leadership. You’ll manage three to five Engineers and hire three to five more. They’ll cover multiple teams and a variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Your day-to-day will include:\n\n - Providing feedback on product and technical specs to help engineers identify where to cut scope or improve quality. You don’t make the final decisions, but you’ll influence and coach ICs to reach the right ones.\n\n - Grow engineers to the point where they can take large, loosely defined projects and deliver them with little intervention.\n\n - Jump into our systems and code to debug a customer issue, ship a small bug fix, or improve our developer experience. Engineering leaders at Ashby are great engineers and enjoy keeping their skills up-to-date (while staying off the critical path).\n\nYou’ll also propose and lead department and company-wide initiatives. Some examples:\n\n - Rethink how we (and the industry) do pull request reviews by aligning on goals with the team, sampling a set of PRs to understand how effective they are, and writing a proposal to the team about what we could change to speed up reviews while giving reviewers the time and space to give useful feedback.\n\n - Design and improve interviews based on candidate and team feedback. We pride ourselves on thoughtful interviews that simulate actually working with us!\n\n - Improve how we generate and simulate data in demo accounts. It’s a project off the critical path, but it helps you keep up-to-date on our codebase while immensely impacting the business, from Engineering to QA to Sales.\n\nI’ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\n - You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology. We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.\n\n - You follow the rules and accept the hand you’ve been dealt. We want folks with the ambition, courage, and follow-through to change things, whether it’s within their own team or across departments.\n\n - You went into management because it was the only growth path available. We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews. You don’t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.\n\n - You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou’ll be an important part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nThis is an important role and our interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (5h 15m):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Benji, our CEO (30m, live)\n\n 6. Final round where you meet Engineers and other Engineering Managers (90m, live)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other. If we don’t move forward, we’re happy to share feedback.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you’ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don’t worry if you don’t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you’ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments.

We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget.

We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾, I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby’s Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an Engineering leader who has done it all: You’ve built impressive products as an IC, you’ve built a bench of amazing Engineers, and you’ve established the cultural norms and processes of an entire Engineering department. Ashby’s success and ambition mean we’re doubling the Engineering team in the next year, and we need your experience and leadership to do it thoughtfully.\n\nOur product and growth are exceptional. Ashby All-in-One is powerful, easy to use, and replaces several venture-backed companies' worth of products (often with a better experience). We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway.\n\nA big part of our secret sauce is how we run Engineering. We achieve incredible speed and quality by discarding many industry norms and being optimistic about Engineers. We consider what makes exceptional Engineers exceptional and then figure out how to hire them and build an environment that gives them the freedom and agency to actually be exceptional.\n\nIn other words, if engineers writing product specs, making product decisions, and not breaking down projects into individual tickets excites you, you’ve found the right place.\n\nAs Head of Engineering in the Americas, you’ll work closely with me and your counterpart in EMEA, Colin, to continue scaling our unique culture. You’ll manage our remote team of 20 engineers and 2 EMs, who cover a wide variety of specializations, from Product Engineers to Site Reliability Engineers to Design Engineers. Over the next year, you’ll grow that team to 40 engineers and 5-6 EMs.\n\nI’ll share more details once we meet.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\n - You’ve always been a line manager or middle manager. You haven’t led the definition and evolution of the culture and processes of an entire Engineering department.\n\n - You’ve never managed managers. Managing other leaders is a very different ball game, and not everyone enjoys it or thrives in it – the seniority of this role won’t let you explore that.\n\n - You don’t enjoy coding or don’t find time to stay up-to-date on technology. We believe great leaders are folks who were great engineers themselves. That starts with loving the craft and never giving it up.\n\n - You went into management because it was the only growth path available. We want folks who could have been Principal engineers (or were one!).\n\n - You're happy with a team of engineers who are predominantly early-career or mid-career or don't thrive with ownership or autonomy. You believe that with enough guardrails, the team can get things done.\n\n - To you, a Staff or Principal Engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or conducting architecture reviews. You don’t believe staff and principal engineers could lead by the example they set or the leverage they create through their work.\n\n - You’re not optimistic or convinced that we can build a large engineering team that functions differently from the status quo. You think, at some size, common processes need to be implemented to ensure consistent product delivery (e.g., sprint planning, product managers writing in-depth specifications). You might not say it out loud, but you think, at some size, compromises have to be made for the sake of hiring numbers or consistency.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\nYou’ll be a critical part of figuring out how to scale these methods from 50 engineers to 100 and beyond.\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers.

The interview process reflects that both in challenge and length (~6.5h):\n\n 1. Introduction call with me (30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. An interview to explore your past experience as a leader (1h, live)\n\n 4. A deep dive into a past project with other Engineering Leaders (1h, live)\n\n 5. Interview with Colin, our Head of EMEA Engineering (45m)\n\n 6. Interview with Benji, our CEO (45m, live)\n\n 7. Final round where you meet various folks on the team (90m)\n\nDepending on my bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Near the end of the process, we’ll do reference checks.\n\nThis is also an important decision for you, so I’m always happy to have coffee chats in person or over Zoom to get to know each other.\n\n\nYOUR FIRST SIX MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nYour first three months at Ashby will be spent learning about Ashby Engineering and easing into leadership. While most of your onboarding will be driven by a 6-month plan you put together (and refine over time), you’ll also ship some product changes and features. What better way to learn how ICs work than to be one! Don’t worry if you don’t know our technologies. The team is really helpful and our dev environment is pretty awesome: it sets up in a single script and you’ll be able to push your first product change on day one.\n\nYou and I will do 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month reviews to calibrate on our unique culture and how you, I, and the team will work together.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options.

    "description": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on code-as-infrastructure. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do.

As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "Hi! I'm John, Ashby's Head of Professional Services. One of my favorite aspects of Ashby is our operating principle of Continuous Improvement https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/culture/ashbys-operating-principles#8---implement-continuous-improvement. Coupled with our principle of caring deeply about our customers, we often find ourselves wondering ‘what is a better way to accomplish this’. That’s why I am thrilled to be hiring our next Integrations Consultant! As the second member of our Integrations Consulting team (within Ashby’s Customer Success organization), you’ll have the opportunity to lead customer facing engagements, focusing on complex technical projects for some of our most strategic customers.\n\n\nABOUT THIS ROLE:\n\nAs our next Integrations Consultant, you’ll be responsible for defining, managing, and executing the technical requirements for strategic customers, specifically those implementing Ashby with one of our custom-built HCM integrations. You will work with customers with varying levels of integration sophistication advising on integration best practices, technical configurations, and working with a customer’s internal expert on how to best achieve their goals. You will use your existing knowledge of both integrations and the products we will be integrating with to consult with our customers, helping them get up and running swiftly with Ashby, so they can ultimately achieve their desired business outcomes. You will partner with Product/Engineering, Implementation Specialists, CSMs, Sales Engineers, and other cross functional partners to achieve this. Ideally, this hire would be located in the EST time zone.\n\nRole requirements:\n\n - Enterprise Human Capital Management (HCM) Integration Experience: You have extensive experience managing and executing integrations with Workday, as well as other enterprise-grade HCM solutions like UKG, ADP, Oracle, and SAP SuccessFactors (defining the work, aligning with stakeholders, communicating the project plan, and ultimately delivering results in accordance with the agreed upon expectations). You keep the team on track to ensure milestones are met. We’d love it if you have a Workday HCM certification. Even better if you’ve also managed integrations with tools listed under Integrations on our Ashby Knowledge Base https://ashbyhq.notion.site/.\n\n - Customer Centricity: You are adept at understanding customer needs and tailoring implementations to meet their specific requirements. You build strong customer relationships by maintaining high levels of engagement and communication; you’re the customer’s proactive guide and advocate throughout the implementation period.\n\n - Change Management: You are experienced in navigating change management processes and helping customers adapt to new systems and a refreshed approach.\n\n - Technical Proficiency: You have a solid understanding of a complex product (ideally Ashby) and its technical intricacies; you are technically curious and creative.\n\n - Consultative: You take pride in advising customers on best practices specific to their usage of software to ensure optimal value.\n\n - Innovative & Principled: You proactively address thematic customer opportunities and improve our processes accordingly. You don’t rely on ‘I’ve seen this done’ but instead think critically to solve problems.\n\n - Cross-functional Collaboration: You effectively partner with cross-functional stakeholders across Customer Success, Sales, Product, Engineering, and Operations to align and define progress.\n\nYou could be a great fit if:\n\n - 📣 You demonstrate clear communication. You ask clarifying questions with precision and can distill complex concepts into simple themes.\n\n - ⚙️ People technology expertise: You have proven experience managing complex integrations with people technology like Workday or other ERPs, including technical solution design and troubleshooting.\n\n - 🎧 You are a great listener. You see your role as the voice of the customer to internal stakeholders so we can ensure that our offerings continue to evolve in accordance with customer needs.\n\n - 📈 You are a problem solver. You thrive at solving complex challenges with innovative, scalable solutions.\n\n - ⚡️You know process matters. You are eager to improve processes and workflows to enhance efficiency and efficacy.\n\n - 🔍 Your peers describe you as detail oriented and technically proficient. You take pride in internal operations.\n\n - 🤹You are adept at managing multiple simultaneous, multithreaded projects and have experience prioritizing based on customer and business needs.\n\n - 📊 You are data-driven. You use metrics and analytics to inform decisions and measure success.\n\n - 🌍 You are adaptable. You can navigate changes in a fast-paced, evolving environment, and would be happy to be the Workday SME in pre-sales conversations when needed.\n\n - 🧑‍🏫 You love to coach. You see every teaching moment as an opportunity and are excited to help our customers grow.\n\nYou might not be a great fit if:\n\n - You have limited experience leading Workday integrations.\n\n - You prefer an in-person role over remote.\n\n - You are less interested in customer-facing roles that require both technical and interpersonal skills.\n\n - You are accustomed to defining ideas and strategies, yet not responsible for their execution.\n\n - You prefer working with a simple product (such as a point solution).\n\n - You prefer exclusively to build (rather than build, iterate, optimize).\n\n\nOUR PHILOSOPHY\n\nHere are a few key points (relevant to the go-to-market side) that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us:\n\n - We spend a lot of time building best-in-class products since we believe a highly differentiated product is a lot easier to sell.\n\n - We want to offer deep expertise whenever we interact with prospects and customers.\n\n - We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people (and the right work environment) deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. We hire and compensate accordingly.\n\nWe value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication (we put a lot of effort into using the right communication channels) - we’ll get into these and other values during the hiring process.\n\n\nTHE INTERVIEW\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. Our interview process is structured to get to know you and your career as well as empower you with insight into our key focus areas.

You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks is recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅\n\n - Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work.

We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews.

You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire.

The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/).

While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. As someone who could design and build software, this position is close to my heart. I always felt I had a unique perspective because I could play with design ideas and iterate in code. My ideas could start in Figma but then be grounded (or sometimes more creative) in code. My prototypes used actual logic and data. My changes cascaded throughout the app for comprehensive critique (thanks, React component system!). But, every company made me pick one —I couldn’t design and build. At Ashby, you can.\n\nWhile every engineer can design and build, you’ll tackle our most challenging design problems and help others improve their designs by expanding and enhancing our in-house design system and consulting on bespoke work. To ground it with examples, engineers who can design at Ashby have:\n\n - Redesigned our mobile web app by talking with customers who use it often, wireframing new flows, implementing its design system, and using it to make the wireframes a reality.\n\n - Built a set of flexible, composable components in our design system that allow other engineers to build custom autocompletes. These autocompletes can contain filters, options to create new records, etc.\n\n - Helped another engineer improve their design's information hierarchy and scannability for viewing a candidate’s assessments. Recruiters can quickly parse information and pick out anomalies.\n\nThese projects reflect what we’re accomplishing at Ashby: improving the productivity of working professionals (starting with talent teams) with intelligent and powerful software. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered & extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do.

We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "jobTitle": "High Touch Customer Success Manager - PST",
    "description": "ABOUT THIS ROLE\n\nHi, I’m Beth, and I’m the Manager of High Touch Customer Success at Ashby. Our team is passionate about shaping and scaling an exceptional high-touch customer experience across the mid-market segment. I'm thrilled to be hiring our next CSM, specifically in the PST or MST timezone, as we continue expanding globally.\n\nAs a member of our Customer Success team, you will help us continue to grow our High Touch Customer Success function. In this role, you'll onboard, train, and support the adoption of Ashby with customers across the region, partnering closely with a talented group of seven CSMs on the Americas High Touch team to shape how we serve companies ranging from high-growth startups to public enterprises.\n\nAshby is designed to be powerful and flexible, allowing users to adjust it to their needs. This means that there is a lot to learn. You will become a product and domain expert in order to enable our customers to make the best use of Ashby to drive hiring excellence.\n\nRole Requirements:\n\n - You have a strong track record of customer success experience in B2B SaaS (at least two years), supporting the implementation and adoption of complex technologies. In this role, you will manage a four to eight week implementation, while continuing to deliver value through the customer journey.\n\n - You’re comfortable managing a book of ~60 mid-market customers, exceeding $1.5MM in total ARR. You enjoy developing relationships across a broad set of stakeholders while supporting existing teams to drive adoption and retention\n\n - You have experience working closely with cross-functional stakeholders across Sales, Marketing, Product, and Operations.\n\n - You love becoming a product and industry expert and have experience doing this in a previous customer success role. You can create ‘Ah ha!’ moments by tailoring training and product walk throughs to address a customer’s specific challenges.\n\n - You’ve worked with technically complex products and show a strong curiosity to explore details and understand how things work.\n\nYou Should Apply If:\n\n - 📣 You demonstrate mastery of clear communication. You ask questions with precision and can explain complex concepts in simple terms. You eschew business jargon.\n\n - 🎧 You are a great listener. You see your role as providing the voice of the customer to internal stakeholders so we can ensure that our product roadmap continues delivering value.\n\n - 📊You enjoy working with a larger book of varied customers, and can effectively prioritise your time to make the biggest impact.\n\n - 🧩 You’re energized by learning and supporting a complex product. You enjoy diving deep into technical details, navigating advanced configurations, and data workflows, and you enjoy helping customers make sense of them.\n\n - 🧑‍🏫 You love to teach. Whether it’s a complex report to a very tenured data analyst, or a workflow to a brand new recruiter, who is new to SaaS tools, you see every teaching moment as an opportunity.\n\n - ⚙️ You are not only excited about driving renewals, but also crafting repeatable processes that will allow our go-to-market team to scale well in future.\n\n - 🔍 Your peers describe you as detail oriented. You obsess over sending crisp follow-up emails, on time. You take pride in internal operations, like real-time CRM updates.\n\n - ⚡️ You move fast. You leverage tools/technology to maximize your time. You are at home managing a wide range of customers, and prioritizing effectively.\n\n - 🗺️ You're energized by an ever-improving work environment. Our team is growing, and continually iterating on processes - we live by our Operating Principle of \"Implement Continuous Improvement\"\n\n - 📊 You are always looking for ways to improve your work through data.\n\n - 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧 You have been a recruiter, hiring manager or interviewer in a previous role. Recruiting experience paired with SaaS CSMing helps to make the onboarding process quicker, and can help you serve as a trusted advisor to our customers. Not a requirement though!\n\nWhy you shouldn’t apply:\n\n - If you tend to thrive with a smaller, more focused book of customers, this role likely isn’t the right fit. Our High Touch CSMs typically manage a book of 60+ customers, balancing personalized relationships with efficient, scalable support.\n\n - You're interested in managing customer accounts with infrequent and well-defined touchpoints (rather than excited by the fluidity required of early stage CS work)\n\n - You shine as an exclusively commercial CSM, motivated by variable compensation. While our team's north star metric is revenue retention, we focus on adoption and engagement as our leading indicators. For renewal negotiation and upsell, we have a lovely team of Contract Managers. As such, this role does not currently include variable pay, aligning with our strategy to hire product-oriented CSMs rather than adhering to the conventional Account Manager model.\n\n - You’re afraid of rolling up your sleeves. If the idea of getting in the weeds with a customer about the nuance between a time in process report and a time to hire report feels too granular, or project managing a workflow change for offer approvals feels “beneath you”, this job isn’t going to be for you.\n\n\nABOUT ASHBY\n\nWe’re building the next generation of enterprise software, and we’re starting with a suite of products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run their hiring process significantly better. Learn more on our website: https://www.ashbyhq.com/%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCWehttps://www.ashbyhq.com/\nhttps://www.ashbyhq.com/%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCWe\n\nWe are well funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom. We have thousands of amazing customers including Snowflake, OpenAI, Shopify, Ramp, Notion, and Zapier (and many others who we cannot name!). Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet. In short, it's the perfect time to join! 🚀\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nOur interview process is thorough - we aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows:\n\n - Intro Call with Ashby Recruiting - 30 Minutes\n\n - Hiring Manager Interview - 45 Minutes\n\n - Mock Customer Call - 45 Minutes\n\n - Virtual Onsite - 2 hours\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - You’ll get the time to do things the right way; we put a lot of emphasis on high quality work and avoid quick hacks as much as possible.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby - do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO with four weeks is recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅\n\n - Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅.\n\nWe’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nHi 👋 I’m Colin https://uk.linkedin.com/in/colinhoweuk, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along.\n\nOur infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure.\n\nHaving herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve.\n\nWe’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on:\n\n - Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler https://www.loom.com/share/32c0cc3eedf2450fb66a901b76186ce4, and create tools to help developers do so\n\n - Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data\n\n - Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime\n\n - Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs.\n\n - Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers.\n\n - Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse.\n\nWe’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take.\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nYou should apply if:\n\n - You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure.\n\n - You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things.\n\n - You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better.\n\n - You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process.\n\n - You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you.\n\nAll that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if:\n\n - You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it.\n\n - You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use.\n\n - You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day.\n\n - Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you.\n\n - You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWe use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik/ and Benji https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjaminencz/’s (our co-founders) belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes.

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for a versatile, persistent product engineer who’s not afraid to set up reusable building blocks across the stack and advocate for the time and space to do so. At Ashby, all our engineers ship features end-to-end at a high pace. Example is the best leadership. We’ll give you the room to do your best work, and you'll be our guide! If that speaks to you, read on.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it’s not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.\n\n - You can get lost in the details. Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n\nENGINEERING CULTURE\n\nOur engineering culture is motivated by Benji’s (my Co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small, talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!). We do it through:\n\n - Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design\n\n - Natural collaboration and deliberate communication\n\n - Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage\n\n - Putting effort into building a diverse team\n\n\nMINIMAL PROCESS & LOTS OF OWNERSHIP\n\nThe best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise.\n\nTraditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.”\n\nAt Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive.\n\n\nCOLLABORATION IS NATURAL & COMMUNICATION IS DELIBERATE\n\nOur engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here https://www.ashbyhq.com/team!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here https://www.ashbyhq.com/blog/company/thoughtful-communication).\n\nTo drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/d4679311-9dba-4031-bf5e-19ce78597ab1/calendar.png]\n\nWe also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region.\n\n\nINCREASE LEVERAGE, NOT TEAM SIZE\n\nWe built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We’ve done this through investment in:\n\n - Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾.\n\n - Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).\n\nHere’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby:\n\n[https://app.ashbyhq.com/api/images/user-content/4ea5f68e-c33e-4ac9-831a-e732bee4a303/8d94727a-46d8-42a2-9627-ddcd7f822f95/arjun.png]\n\nAnd a demo of one of these building blocks:\n\n\nPUT EFFORT INTO DIVERSITY\n\nDiverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.\n\nToday, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.\n\n\nINTERVIEW PROCESS\n\nAt Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises.\n\nOur interview process is three rounds:\n\n 1. Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live)\n\n 2. A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live)\n\n 3. Three non-coding interviews that focus on product thinking, technical design, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days)\n\nDepending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter.\n\nYour hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback!\n\n\nYOUR FIRST THREE MONTHS AT ASHBY\n\nWe want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together.\n\nIt’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture.\n\n\nTECHNOLOGY STACK\n\nI’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful 😀): TypeScript (frontend & backend), React, GraphQL API, Node.js, Postgres, Redis.\n\nWhen they joined Ashby, many of our engineers switched from other languages like Swift and Kotlin (Ben https://linkedin.com/in/benasher44/), platforms like iOS (Tom https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-quist-0925a199/) and Windows (Sergey https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergeygalich/). We care more about fundamentals (e.g., debugging, abstractions) and how fast you learn. For folks on the team who switched, it's nice seeing changes hot reload versus waiting for XCode to compile 😅.\n\n\nBENEFITS\n\n - Competitive salary and equity.\n\n - 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable.\n\n - Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it.\n\n - A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements.\n\n - Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!\n\n - $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.\n\n - If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us.\n\nAshby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.\n\nAshby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.",

    "description": "Hi 👋🏾 I’m Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We’re looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: tens of thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.\n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou’ve probably seen this role posted before, and it’s because we’re always expanding the team (we’re on track to double this year). We’re bubbling with ideas on how to support Talent Acquisition through software, and we’ve started the journey of building products beyond Talent Acquisition. We read every application and aim to respond to yours within 3-4 days (often sooner).\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE AND HOW WE WORK\n\nOur engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs – where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.\n\nI started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.\n\nI studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.\n\nInnovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer’s force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of \"Agile\" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.\n\nAt Ashby, we’re building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you’ll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You’ll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:\n\n - Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the “Calendar Tetris” problem I talk about in \"What We're Building.\"\n\n - Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.\n\n - Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.\n\n\nWHAT WE’RE BUILDING\n\nAs engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back.\n\nScheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help.\n\nAs hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are!\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN’T APPLY\n\nSoftware engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you’re looking for:\n\n - You’re not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what’s necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We’ll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\n - You’ve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We’re not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\n - You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn’t built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn’t infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we’ve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\n - You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you’ve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you’ll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\n - You’re an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don’t mean you work in a vacuum. You’ll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!\n\n - You seek to create leverage in your work. The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc.\n\nPut another way, you shouldn’t apply if:\n\n - You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line. Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You’d rather focus on the technical details and challenges.\n\n - You only want to do exciting work. We’re building a team of kind, collaborative folks.

Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.\n\n - You haven’t led or taken ownership of projects before. You’re used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.\n\n - You want to mentor earlier-career engineers. We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.\n\n - To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews. Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems.
