      <h1>About ArtSource Brazil</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to ArtSource Brazil, the premier job board dedicated to the vibrant creative
        industries in Brazil. Our mission is simple: to bridge the gap between exceptional local
        talent and the studios, companies, and projects that need them most.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Focus</h2>
      <p>
        Brazil is a powerhouse of creativity, home to world-class artists, designers, animators, and
        game developers. Yet, finding the right opportunities or the right talent can be a
        challenge. ArtSource Brazil was created to solve this problem. We focus exclusively on
        creative roles, from 3D and Animation to Game Development and UI/UX Design, ensuring that
        every listing is relevant and high-quality.
