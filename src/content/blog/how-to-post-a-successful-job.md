Attracting top-tier creative talent requires more than just listing a job title. It's about telling a story and showing candidates why your company is the best place for their skills. At ArtSource Brazil, we've seen what works. Here’s our guide to crafting a job post that stands out.

## 1. Start with a Clear and Concise Job Title

Your title is the first thing a candidate sees. Be specific and use industry-standard terms.

-   **Good:** `Senior 3D Environment Artist (Stylized)`
-   **Avoid:** `3D Ninja Wanted` or `Rockstar Artist`

Clarity beats cleverness. Candidates search for specific roles, and a clear title ensures your post appears in their search results.

## 2. Write a Compelling Job Description

This is your sales pitch. Go beyond a simple list of responsibilities.

-   **Introduce the Project:** What exciting project will the new hire be working on? Is it a new game, an animated short, or a cutting-edge app?
-   **Describe the Role's Impact:** How will this person contribute to the team and the final product? Give them a sense of purpose.
-   **Outline Day-to-Day Responsibilities:** Be clear about the core tasks. This helps candidates assess if their skills are a good match.

## 3. Be Transparent About Requirements

List the essential skills and qualifications. Differentiate between "must-haves" and "nice-to-haves."

-   **Must-Haves:** Core skills without which a candidate cannot succeed (e.g., "Proficiency in Blender and Substance Painter").
-   **Nice-to-Haves:** Skills that are a bonus but not a deal-breaker (e.g., "Experience with Unreal Engine 5" or "Knowledge of Portuguese").

Being honest here saves time for both you and the applicants.

## 4. Showcase Your Company Culture

Why should someone work for *you*?

-   Mention your work philosophy (e.g., remote-first, flexible hours).
-   Talk about the team they'll be joining.
-   Highlight any unique perks or benefits.

Top talent looks for a great environment, not just a good salary.

## 5. Provide Clear Application Instructions

Make it easy to apply. Our "Post a Job" process guides you through adding an application link or email. Ensure that link leads directly to the application form or provides a clear `mailto:` address. The fewer clicks, the higher the conversion rate.

By following these steps, you'll create a job listing that not only attracts more applicants but attracts the *right* applicants.
